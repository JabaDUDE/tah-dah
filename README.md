"Tah-Dah" is a unique change in perspective for those with ADHD! Instead of focusing 
on what tasks that you need to complete, which can be daunting and, therefore, difficult to start, 
you focus on all the things you have already done throughout the day! This app should inspire a feeling
of accomplishment at getting things done 
instead of dredding the seemingly endless list of thing that still need to be done!
